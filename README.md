# Emerging-Tech Programming Assignment 

This repository contains jupyter notebooks and a python script for my final year christmas project for the module Emerging technologies 
thought by our lecturer Dr. Ian Mcloughlin.

The spcecifcations of the project can be found [here.](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/emtech-assignment-2018/raw/master/project.pdf) 
But a quick overview of the project was that we had five sections as follows:

1. **Numpy Random Jupyter Notebook:** <br /> 
A notebook containing the basics of the python library NumPy , this includes Mathematic functions, Array examples and Simple graphs using Matplotlib.

2. **Iris Dataset Jupyter Notebook:** <br /> 
A notebook explaining the Iris Dataset and how we can create a neural network using Keras and how to train our model using different
images of the species of the Iris flower. I also go through how we can test our model and save and reload our model.

3. **Mnist Dataset Jupyter Notebook:** <br /> 
This notebook explains what the Mnist Dataset is and how to load each of the images and labels into memory using NumPy. I also show
how we can save this images locally. I also give a brief demonstration on how to create a neural network similar to our one in the Iris 
dataset and train and test our model.

4. **A digit recognition python script:** <br /> 
A python script which elaberates more on our previous notebook. I created a python script which creates a model using keras which is used
to train and test using the mnist dataset. I also have a function which takes in the user image and converts it so that it is ready 
to be evaluated by our network. I also added a nice drawable canvas which I found online which lets the user draw a number and our network
can also predict what number it is. All this is nicely displayed using a command prompt style user interface.

5. **Script explanation Jupyter Notebook:** <br /> 
A simple notebook explaining our python script we created previously. 

## Getting Started: 

### **Install Jupyter Notebook:** <br /> 
If you would like to run my notebooks locally you need to install Jupyter notebook which can be found [here.](http://jupyter.org/)

### **Install Python using Anaconda:** <br /> 
We can install Python using Anaconda which can be found [here.](http://jupyter.org/)

### **Install Tensorflow and Keras:** <br /> 
In our Anaconda command prompt run the command : *pip install tensorflow*
<br />
Next run the command: 
conda install -c conda-forge keras 

### Download and run instructions:
Clone my project down locally using the command: *git clone https://github.com/KeithH4666/Programming-Assignment-For-Emerging-Tech*
<br />

Run the notebooks by using the anaconda command prompt to go into the folder where you cloned my project and run the command: *Jupyter Notebook*
<br />

Run my digit recognition script by once again using the Anaconda command prompt in the folder where the project is cloned and run the command: *py handwritten.py*
